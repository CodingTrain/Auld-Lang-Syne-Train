## Auld Lang Syne (original)

```
C                        G7
Should tensor dim be denied

    C                F
And cause a fatal error

       C                 G7
Should I lose my mind?

Am          F    G7   C
I'll comment out the working code.

F   C         G7
And start afresh next time

    C         F
O tensor dim, o tensor dim,

      C            G7
What is the correct shape?

    Am      F    G7   C
I am losing my mind!
```
