## Auld Lang Syne (original)

```
C                        G7
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

    C                F
And never brought to mind

       C                 G7
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

Am          F    G7   C
And days of auld lang syne

F   C         G7
For auld lang syne, my dear,

    C         F
For auld lang syne,

      C            G7
We'll take a cup o'kindness yet

    Am      F    G7   C
And days of auld lang syne
```
